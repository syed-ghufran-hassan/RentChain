# RentChain
It is a decentralized rental management system built on Ethereum, leveraging smart contracts to streamline and secure the rental process for property owners and tenants. The system aims to modernize property rentals by using blockchain technology to ensure transparency, trust, and efficiency.

## Main Concept:
The platform provides a trustless environment where property owners can list their properties, and tenants can securely rent them without intermediaries. Ethereum smart contracts are used to automate the rental agreement process, manage security deposits via escrow, and record rental history, ensuring all transactions are verifiable and tamper-proof.
