# RentChain
 

**RentChain** is a decentralized rental agreement orchestrator built on Ethereum. It automates the entire rental lifecycle—from signing and escrow to rent collection, lease termination, and dispute recording—using smart contracts. All transactions and rental history are stored immutably on-chain, providing transparency and building reputation for both tenants and property owners.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Trustless Agreements** – Rental terms (rent, deposit, duration, payment schedule) are encoded in smart contracts.
- **Escrow Service** – Security deposits are held in the contract and released only when conditions are met.
- **Automated Payments** – Tenants pay rent on a fixed schedule; owners can withdraw accumulated rent at any time.
- **Immutable Rental History** – Every agreement, payment, activation, and dispute is recorded via the `RentalHistory` contract.
- **Ethereum Address Authentication** – No emails or passwords; users authenticate with their wallet.
- **Dispute Mechanism** – Parties can flag a dispute on-chain, which is immediately recorded in the history.
- **Factory Pattern** – New rental agreements are deployed via a factory, ensuring clean deployment and easy tracking.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of three core contracts:

| Contract | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **RentalHistory** | Stores immutable records of all agreements, payments, and events per user. Implements the `IRentalHistory` interface. |
| **RentalAgreement** | Handles the rental lifecycle: signing, escrow, rent payments, lease ending, deposit release, and disputes. Uses OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`. |
| **RentChainFactory** | Deploys new `RentalAgreement` instances and automatically registers them in `RentalHistory`. |
